<h2>Historical Origins</h2>
<p>Lunar New Year is one of the most important and meaningful festivals in many Asian countries,
especially in China, Vietnam, Korea, and Southeast Asia. It marks the beginning of the new year
according to the lunar calendar and usually takes place in late January or early February.</p>
<p>The history of Lunar New Year goes back thousands of years. People believed the new year was
a chance to say goodbye to bad luck and welcome good fortune. Farmers celebrated the end of
the farming year and hoped for good weather and a successful harvest.</p>
